                    Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a concept that bridges the physical world of industrial operations with the digital world of information and technology. IIoT connects sensors and devices across an industrial network to provide real-time data and analysis to improve operational efficiency and operational insights. A control system is a system that provides automation for industrial operations that includes control of machines, robotics, workflows, and data. IIoT and control systems use sensors, actuators, and control systems to provide connectivity between machines, people and information. These technologies enable remote monitoring and control of operations, as well as communications between different systems and machines. IIoT and control systems can provide real-time visibility into operations, predictive maintenance and asset tracking, automated process control, and more. IIoT enables connectivity, real-time insight and actionable data across the enterprise. This connectivity brings together the people, process, and systems across different departments and locations through a single platform. IIoT enables automation across the enterprise by leveraging sensors, control systems, and other devices connected over an industrial network.

                            In the manufacturing industry, IIoT and control systems can be used to improve operational efficiency, deploy predictive maintenance and asset tracking, and provide real-time monitoring and analytics. In the manufacturing sector, IIoT is used to optimize the supply chain, create a more connected workforce, and improve customer satisfaction. In supply chain operations, sensors can be used to capture data about the condition of products in transit. This data is then transmitted to the enterprise, where it is analyzed to determine if products are safe for consumption. For example, sensors can be used to monitor temperatures in cold-chain transportation. This data can be used to determine if food or other products are safe to consume. In enterprise operations, sensors can be used to monitor things like temperature, pressure, and flow in industrial equipment. This data can be used to determine if repairs are needed or if equipment needs to be replaced. For example, sensors can be used to monitor the temperature in oil and gas pipelines to ensure they are safe and functioning properly.

                            In the transportation sector, IIoT and control systems can be used to improve operational efficiency and asset tracking. IIoT is used to manage fleets and assets, and can provide visibility into equipment and personnel. For example, an organization can use sensors to monitor the speed, location, and other data about vehicles in a fleet. This data can be used to optimize routes and dispatch vehicles more efficiently.

                            It’s important to consider the type of data you need, the environment you’ll be using the sensor in, and the accuracy you require. Once you have a better idea of what you need, you can begin narrowing down your choices to the best sensor for the job. With the right industrial sensor selection, you can ensure that your application is running optimally and safely.
