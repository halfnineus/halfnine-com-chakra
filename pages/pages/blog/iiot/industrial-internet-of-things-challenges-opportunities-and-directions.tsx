                    What is Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)?
                </Heading>
                <Text pb={12} color={'gray.700'}>
                    The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the network of machines that are connected to each other and have the ability to collect and exchange data. Machines, such as sensors, computers, robots, etc. can be programmed to collect data and communicate information with other machines in a seamless manner. The IIoT can help to increase efficiency and reduce costs in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and oil and gas. IIoT systems are expected to grow significantly with the total number of devices forecast to grow to 50 billion by 2020. The industrial Internet of Things can be seen as a subset of the Internet of Things that is used in industrial settings. The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is a collaborative effort by industry to advance operational technology through the application of modern technologies. Since Industrial Internet of Things is an extension of the Internet of Things, it is also a network of interconnected devices that collect and exchange data. Devices can be sensors, computers, robots, etc. IIoT systems usually have a centralized system that makes decisions based on the data collected by sensors.

                    Challenges of IIoT
                </Heading>
                <Text pb={12} color={'gray.700'}>
                    When it comes to challenges, there are many that the industrial Internet of Things will bring. However, most of these challenges can be overcome with proper planning and execution. Some of the challenges of using IIoT are: Industry Awareness: The first challenge associated with IIoT is the potential for industry awareness. It is vital to ensure that everyone is aware of the potential benefits that come with the industrial Internet of Things. It is important to be aware of the dangers of going over the edge and creating a cybersecurity risk. It is essential to understand that security cannot be addressed once the system is implemented. This is something that must be addressed at the very beginning. Industry Collaboration: The industrial Internet of Things is a collaborative effort by industrial sectors to advance operational technology through the application of modern technologies. In order to achieve the desired result and reap the benefits of this modern technology, it is essential to collaborate with other industrial sectors such as healthcare, transportation, and oil and gas. Collaborating with other industrial sectors will ensure that there is a seamless communication between industries, which will allow for better decision-making.

                    When it comes to the opportunities of IIoT, there are many that companies can take advantage of. Some of the opportunities include: Industry Collaboration: The collaborative efforts of different industries to adopt the industrial Internet of Things can result in several benefits for industries involved in the collaboration. The collaboration between industries will allow for better decision-making, as different industries will be sharing data seamlessly. The collaboration will also allow for better and more accurate forecasting, as industries will be able to collect data from different sources and make decisions based on the data collected. Increased Efficiency: One of the major advantages of industrial Internet of Things is its ability to increase efficiency in operations. The adoption of IIoT will allow for a more streamlined process and will allow for increased productivity and profitability. The industrial Internet of Things will allow for a better supply chain management, which will help to reduce or eliminate fraud and theft. The industrial Internet of Things will also allow for a better customer relationship, which will result in increased customer satisfaction.

                <Text pb={12} color={'gray.700'}>
                    When it comes to data security, all industries must ensure that the data collected by sensors and the Industrial Internet of Things is secure. It is important to ensure that the data collected from sensors is not tampered with and is unreadable. Industries can adopt a variety of methods to ensure that the data collected is secure, such as building a firewall or implementing a blockchain technology. There are two ways in which data can be secured. One way is to encrypt the data, wherein the data is transformed into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered with a secret key. The other method is to put the data in a secure data storage system like a database with high-level access controls like user authentication, role-based access control, etc.
