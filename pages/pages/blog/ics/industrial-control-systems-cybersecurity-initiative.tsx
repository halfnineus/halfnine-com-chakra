                    The Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative (ICS-CERT) is a critical initiative that provides businesses with the tools, resources, and information needed to protect industrial control systems (ICS), including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. ICS-CERT was established by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in order to help organizations secure their industrial control systems and prevent potential cyber attacks. The primary goal of ICS-CERT is to promote effective and timely mitigation of cyber risks to critical infrastructure, including industrial control systems. ICS-CERT provides businesses with the knowledge and resources they need to properly protect their systems against cyber threats. ICS-CERT leverages the combined expertise and knowledge of industry partners, including government organizations, utilities, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing organizations, as well as security researchers and other stakeholders. ICS-CERT also provides a variety of resources to businesses and organizations, including technical information, recommended practices, and best practices.

                    Although industrial control systems may be used in various industries, the primary purpose of ICS-CERT is to inform, protect, and secure critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure is defined as systems that, if attacked, could cause mass disruption to society and/or critical services. This can include power grids, water systems, health care facilities, transportation systems, and financial institutions. ICS-CERT partners with organizations and provides them with the tools they need to secure their industrial control systems. This includes providing risk assessments and reports, along with recommendations on how to mitigate risks.

                    There are many cybersecurity threats to industrial control systems, including SCADA systems. These threats can include viruses, worms, denial-of-service attacks, and other malicious software or activities. Other threats can include unauthorized access, natural disasters, and physical damage to systems. The majority of these threats are targeted towards specific systems and are not widespread across the industry. Many organizations and stakeholders, including ICS-CERT, are working to help secure industrial control systems and prevent these threats from impacting businesses.
